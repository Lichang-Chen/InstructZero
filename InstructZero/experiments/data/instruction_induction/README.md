# Data
Data for the instruction induction experiments. Followed We collect another 8 instruction induction tasks besides 24 tasks in [Instruction Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10782).


## Content

- induction_input: includes the inputs utilized in our experiments on instruction induction. Each input consists of our instruction induction prompt along with five demonstrations of task input-output.
- raw:
	- induce: comprises input-output demonstrations that were utilized in the creation of the instruction induction inputs.
	- execute: examples that were withheld for evaluating the accuracy of execution.
